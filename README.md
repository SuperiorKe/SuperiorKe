### Building AI Tools That Actually Matter

</div>

<br>

I am Kenn. Founder of **SuperiaTech**, where We build AI-powered tools that help skilled artisans, fundis, and small business owners in Nairobi automate their work, save time, and compete professionally.

**My mission**: Turn real-world problems into useful solutions that move people forward.

<br>

## Why Kenn?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

**I am a Problem Solver**  
I see inefficiencies everywhere and can't help but think, "there's gotta be a better way." Every line of code I write is focused on **impact over complexity**.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Execution Over Everything**  
Ideas are cheap. I ship fast, learn, and iterate based on real user feedback. My GitHub reflects this â€” lean MVPs that solve actual problems.

<tr>
<td width="50%">

**Local Impact, Global Standards**  
I build for my community in Nairobi, but with the polish and scalability that could work anywhere. Real users, real problems, world-class solutions.

</td>
<td width="50%">

**Bridge Builder**  
I translate between worlds â€” from AI research papers to SMS-based interfaces that work on basic phones. Complex tech made accessible.

## Featured Work

### ðŸ”§ [Artisan Task Manager](https://github.com/SuperiorKe/artisan-task-manager)
*The foundation for everything I'm building*

This is a web-based task management app for skilled artisans and small business owners. Simple signup, intuitive task tracking, professional client communication.

**Why it matters**: Local fundis are incredibly skilled but often struggle with admin tasks - organisation and professional presentation. This levels the playing field.
