# Backend Engineer & Cloud Architect 🚀  
**Express.js • TypeScript • PostgreSQL • REST APIs • Docker • Fintech**

Hello, I am Kenn, A self-taught backend engineer passionate about building **scalable, secure, and high-impact systems**. I specialise in turning complex product needs into clean, reliable backend services. Whether it's building RESTful APIs, architecting databases, or integrating with financial systems, I thrive in the backend trenches.

I am currently focused on building tools that **help real-world users automate, save time, and grow** — especially in emerging markets like Nairobi.
